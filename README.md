# LE-Scraper

In the script above, you need to replace 'your_client_id', 'your_client_secret', and 'your_access_token' with your own LinkedIn API credentials.

To obtain the company_id, you can either search for the company on LinkedIn using the LinkedIn API's "Company Search" endpoint or manually retrieve it from the company's LinkedIn URL.

Please note that access to certain LinkedIn API endpoints and data may be restricted based on your LinkedIn Developer account type and API permissions. Additionally, the number of results returned by the API may be limited, so you may need to handle pagination to retrieve all the employees if the company has a large workforce.

Remember to comply with LinkedIn's API terms of service and any applicable usage limits.
